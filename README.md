Family alert App is considered primarily a family safety tool.
Our Application basically lets a family set up a private network, then with a click of a button, they can let each other know where they are and if they're safe. 
1) During kerela floods  recently, many people were unable to get through to loved ones on their Cellphones . Thousands of people using our Application could have instantly tell their loved ones that they were fine.

2) You can also enable background tracking so everyone in your private network can continuously share their locations with one another.

3) This app also has a panic alert feature you can activate to immediately contact family members via text, email and a voice call to give your location at the moment you need help.

4) There are also options for regular feature phones. For family members without a phone, there is an additional GPS device that can be provided .

5)  This app also notifies our contacts of our location and safety status. The “Check In” button sends a clear message that you’re okay.
